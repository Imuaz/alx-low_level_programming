# Low-Level Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming.

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX SE Program. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

- [0x00-hello_world](0x00-hello_world)
- [0x01-variables_if_else_while](0x01-variables_if_else_while)

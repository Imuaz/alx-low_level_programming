# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings:inbox_tray:

***INTRODUCTION***

The project covered a range of C programming topics, including pointers and arrays, differences between them, and their practical applications. It also explained how to use strings and manipulate them, as well as the scope of variables, including their lifetime and accessibility in a program. In summary, the project provided a comprehensive overview of these programming concepts and their importance in software development.

## Requirements:pushpin:

**General**
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files end with a new line
- A mandatory [README.md](./README.md) file, at the root of the folder of the project has been provided
- The code uses the `Betty` style. It may be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- It does not use global variables
- It has no more than 5 functions per file
- It does not use the standard library. Use any functions like `printf`, `puts`, etcâ€¦ was forbidden
- it uses  [_putchar](./_putchar.c)
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` has been included the header file called [main.h](./main.h) in this directory.

# C - Preprocessor

In this project I learnt about tge following:
1. macros and how to use them
2. the most common predefined macros, and
3. How to include guard your header files

## Tasks

* **0. Object-like Macro**
  * [0-object_like_macro.h](0-object_like_macro.h): Header filr that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.
* **1. Pi**
  * [1-pi.h](1-pi.h): Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
* **2. File name**
  * [2-main.c](2-main.c): a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a newline.
* **3. Function-like macro**
  * [3-function_like_macro.h](3-function_like_macro.h): C function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
* **4. SUM**
  * [4-sum.h](4-sum.h): C function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.

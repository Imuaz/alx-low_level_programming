# C-variables_if_else_while

This project require the (man) knowledge of; `ascii `,`scanf`, `getc`, `getchar`, `EOF`, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `time`, `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX`, `for` loops, `do...while` loops, functions.

Generally, I learn about;
- the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them.
- the relational operators and how to use them
- the values that are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- the boolean operators and how to use them
- the uses the `if`, `if ... else` statements and the uses of comments.
I also learn;
- How to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, `unsigned int`
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type `char`, `int`, `unsigned int` with `printf`
- How to use the `while` loop
- How to use variables with the `while` loop
- How to print variables using `printf`
- What is the `ASCII` character set
- What are the purpose of the `gcc` flags `-m32` and `-m64`.

## Taks

**0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**

* [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
  - it the completion of this [source code](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/rrqNDWjrCWdARnWFLPExPw).
  - it prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
	- the variable `n` stores a different value every time the program is run
	- understanding what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do is not required
	- the output of the program is that;
	  * The number, followed by
		  - if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
			- if the number is 0: `is zero`
			- if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
		* followed by a new line.

**1. The last digit**
* [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): C the program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable
